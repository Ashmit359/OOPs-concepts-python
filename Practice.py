# Letâ€˜s Practice
# Create student class that takes name & marks of 3 subjects as arguments in constructor. 
# Then create a method to print the average.

class student :
    def __init__(self,name,marks):
        self.name = name
        self.marks = marks


    def get_avg(self):
        sum = 0
        for val in self.marks:
            sum += val
        print("hi",self.name,"your avg score is ",sum/3)
